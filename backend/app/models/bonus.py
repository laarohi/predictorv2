"""Bonus-question prediction + answer models.

Questions themselves live in `config/worldcup2026.yml` under the `bonus:`
key — they're tournament config, not data. These tables only hold:

- One row per (user, question) for user picks (`bonus_predictions`)
- One row per (competition, question) for the correct answer
  (`bonus_answers`), set by the admin when the answer is known.

`question_id` is the stable string key from the YAML (e.g. "dark_horse",
"top_scorer"). When the YAML changes question IDs, predictions for the
old ID become orphaned and the admin enters new correct answers.
