"""ESPN public scoreboard client — unofficial JSON API, no auth required.

Primary LIVE score source: ESPN's site API updates in-play scores in near
real time, while Football-Data.org's free tier delivers them with a delay.
The endpoint is the same one every espn.com browser tab polls, so our one
request per minute during match windows is negligible traffic.

Role split (see external_scores.get_score_provider): ESPN paints live
scores and emits completed matches as non-authoritative finals — enough to
finish a group-stage fixture instantly. Knockout finals still land via
Football-Data's per-fixture resolution pass, which carries the
authoritative FT/ET/penalties split our scoring expects.
