"""Scoring calculation service.

Point calculation for match predictions and advancement predictions.
All scoring rules are configurable via YAML.

Supports multiple scoring modes:
- "fixed": Flat points for correct outcome
- "hybrid": Base points + bonus based on how rare the correct answer is

Scoring modes are extensible via the SCORING_STRATEGIES dict.
