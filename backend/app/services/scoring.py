"""Scoring calculation service.

Point calculation for match predictions and advancement predictions.
All scoring rules are configurable via YAML.

Supports multiple scoring modes:
- "fixed": Flat points for correct outcome
- "hybrid": Base points + integer-division rarity bonus (legacy, kept for
  comparison)
- "logarithmic": Base points + Shannon-surprisal rarity bonus
  R = min(cap, round(alpha * log2(1 / (2f))))
  where f = correct_predictors / total_predictors and
  alpha = 10/log2(15) so f = 1/30 hits the cap of 10.

Scoring modes are extensible via the SCORING_STRATEGIES dict.
