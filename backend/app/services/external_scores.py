"""External score fetching service.

Two providers, ESPN-first:
  - ESPN (unofficial public JSON) paints LIVE in-play scores — near
    real-time, no auth — and emits finished matches as non-authoritative
    finals (good enough to finish a group match instantly; knockout
    finals wait for the FT/ET/pens split).
  - Football-Data.org is the authoritative finisher for knockout matches
    (proper FT/ET/pens split via the per-fixture resolution pass) and the
    bulk fallback if ESPN errors on a tick. Its free tier omits in-play
    scores (fullTime stays null until their delayed feed finishes the
    match), so scores are kept None when absent — never coerced to 0.
