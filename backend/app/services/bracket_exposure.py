"""Bracket-exposure computation.

Replaces the fixed `stubBracketExposure` on the frontend with a real
calculation of how many bracket points a user still has on the line.

Definition:
- "Points available" = sum of the scoring config's per-stage points for
  every knockout pick the user has locked in, assuming all picks are
  still alive. Multiplied by the phase multiplier.

  This is the *maximum* exposure — before any matches have been played,
  every pick is potentially still earning. As teams get eliminated this
  number should drop, but we don't have a "team eliminated" signal in
  the data yet, so for now we always report the maximum. (When live
  match results arrive — see the deferred Football-Data.org work — this
  service can subtract picks whose team was knocked out.)

- "Picks locked" / "picks total" — straightforward fraction of the
  bracket the user has filled in. Total is canonical to the FIFA 2026
  format (32 knockout picks across R32 → winner).

- "Final pick" — the (winner, opponent) pair extracted from the user's
  `winner` stage prediction and the other `final` stage prediction.
